## Installation
The `docker-compose.yml` assumes that a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) installation using the [Composer template for Drupal projects](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project) is present in the `drupal` directory within the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project.git drupal
```
